                    <p>I love the web and everything about it, ever since Tim Berners-Lee all those years ago developed
                        a way to have two computers talking to each other, the web has been in our lives. Everyday we make
                        strides in technology and how it impacts our day to day tasks, from shopping to chatting the
                        internet plays a huge role in everything we do. My aim some 9 years ago was to figure out how it was
                        done and make my own way in the race that seems to never stop and I must say what an exciting time it
                        is to be at the forefront of an industry that is all ways progressing.</p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see from this portfolio I like green and purple and my dogs. They feature very highly in my life
                        and have fitted in for many years. Along with my beloved Oxford Utd I'm also a Miami Dolphins fan, I think that's
                        where the green comes from.

                <p>My passion is web development and all things internet, I love to learn new ways to make cool things. Be it a website or application that helps
                take a business to the next level. For many years I have worked in the front end and now I see myself as a back end developer, with my ever growing
                portfolio giving me the push to make all this happen. I have taken on projects that are well out of my skills set to try and tackle the issues it
                bring up, I love to get my teeth in to a large build and really push the limits of what I know and what I need to learn.</p>
                <p>
                    Training for me is a daily task, like eating my breakfast or brushing my teeth I always try and learn something new every day, not only from
                    the wonderful developers I have met along the way but also I use a service call Treehouse which has been 100% fully behind my web developing
                    work life. The school has wonderful content and teachers which has pushed me to fill my mind with so much, you can check out my profile
