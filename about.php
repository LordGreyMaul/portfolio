                    <p>I love the web and everything about it, ever since Tim Berners-Lee all those years ago developed
                        a way to have two computers talking to each other, the web has been in our lives. Everyday we make
                        strides in technology and how it impacts our day to day tasks, from shopping to chatting the
                        internet plays a huge role in everything we do. My aim some 9 years ago was to figure out how it was
                        done and make my own way in the race that seems to never stop and I must say what an exciting time it
                        is to be at the forefront of an industry that is all ways progressing.</p>

                        As you can see from this portfolio I like green and purple and my dogs. They feature very highly in my life
                        and have fitted in for many years. Along with my beloved Oxford Utd I'm also a Miami Dolphins fan, I think that's
                        where the green comes from.
